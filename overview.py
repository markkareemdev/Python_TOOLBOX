#  empty line spaces before variable declaration really matters in python
#  in python there is no variable declaration like in js.. where yo have let,var and const type of variables respectively


# Data types in python
# 1.
# number data types
# using the typeof all variables must be declared except that of a complex number 
# the coefficient oof the complex variable must be used.

# a = 5
# b = 6.0
# m = 1-1j

# print (a, "is type of ", type(a))
# print (b, "is type of ", type(b))
# print(m,isinstance(1-1j, complex))

#2.
# List data types
# list = [1,2,3,4,5]
# print(list[2])
# using the slicing operator
# print(list[0:4]) 
# changing list item
# list[4] = 6;
# print(list)

# 3
# Tuple data types
# an ordered sequence of items just as a list
# unlike list tuples are immutable once created.
# it values can be extracted using the slicing operator, []
# it is defined with parenthesis ()
# t = (5, "program", 1+4j)
# print(t[1])


#4
#python strings
# a slicing operator can be used here to
# space is also countd as a string here
# strings are also immutable

# s = "This is a string."
# p = ''' A multiLine
#         string'''
# print(s)
# print(p)

# print(s[4:18])
